Privacy Policy

Last updated: December 11, 2025

1. Information We Collect

Who’s Game? is built with privacy by design. We collect no personal data and do not track or identify users in any way.

• No personal information: We do not collect names, emails, usernames, or any personally identifiable information.
• No accounts: The app runs entirely offline and does not require registration or login.
• Local storage only: All game content you create, preferences you set, and app settings are stored locally on your device.
• Crash reporting: Crash reporting is currently disabled. No crash data or error logs are collected or transmitted.
• Analytics: Analytics tracking is disabled. No usage data is collected or shared.

2. Local Data Storage

All data created or used within the app stays on your device through secure local storage (AsyncStorage). This includes:

• Game preferences (haptics, layout mode, bold text, spicy mode)
• User-created game content (e.g., Would You Rather packs, This or That packs)
• Voting tallies for shared games

Nothing is sent to our servers automatically. Your game content stays private unless you choose to share it through the app’s sharing features.

3. Data Sharing

We do not sell, share, or transmit your personal data to third parties. Data is only transmitted when:

• You directly use the app’s sharing features to send game links or images
• You contact us by email (support@whosgame.app
)

Shared game links contain only the game content you choose to include. No data is stored on our servers.

4. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:

• Expo and React Native: Frameworks used to build the app. These services may collect anonymous technical data for their own operations. We do not access or store this information.
• App Stores: When downloading the app through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, their respective privacy policies apply to the download and installation process.

5. Children’s Privacy

The app does not collect personal data, making it compliant with children’s privacy requirements, including COPPA.
However, children under 13 should use the app with parental guidance, especially when using sharing features or creating content.

6. Your Rights

You remain fully in control of your data:

• All data stays on your device
• You can delete the app at any time to remove all stored data
• You choose what content you share through the app
