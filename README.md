Privacy Policy
1. Information We Collect

Who’s Game? is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information:

• No personal data: We do not collect accounts, emails, usernames, or any personally identifiable information.
• No user accounts: The app works entirely offline and does not require registration or login.
• Local storage only: All game content you create, game preferences, and app settings are stored locally on your device using secure local storage.
• Crash reporting: If enabled, we may collect anonymous crash reports and error logs through Sentry to help improve app stability. These reports do not contain personal information.
• Analytics: Analytics tracking is currently disabled. If enabled in the future, it would be used only to understand app usage patterns and would remain anonymous.

2. Local Data Storage

All your game data, preferences, and created content are stored locally on your device using secure local storage (AsyncStorage). This includes:

• Game preferences (haptics, layout mode, bold text, spicy mode)
• User-created game content (Would You Rather packs, This or That packs, etc.)
• Voting tallies for shared games

Nothing is automatically transmitted to our servers. Your game content remains private on your device unless you explicitly choose to share it through the app’s sharing features.

3. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transmit your personal data to third parties. The only data transmission occurs when:

• You explicitly use the app’s sharing features to share game links or images with others
• Crash reports are sent to Sentry (if enabled) for app improvement purposes
• You contact us via email (support@whosgame.app
)

Shared game links contain only the game content you choose to share, encoded in the URL itself. No server-side storage is involved.

4. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services:

• Expo and React Native: Frameworks for app development. They may collect anonymous usage data for their services, but we do not access or store this data.
• Sentry: Optional crash reporting service. Only used if crash reporting is enabled. Sentry’s privacy policy applies: https://sentry.io/privacy/

• App Stores: When you download the app through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store, their respective privacy policies apply to the download and purchase process.

5. Children’s Privacy

Our app is suitable for all ages. Since we do not collect personal information or require accounts, we comply with children’s privacy requirements including COPPA. However, users under 13 should have parental supervision when using the app, especially when sharing content with others.

6. Your Rights

You have full control over your data:

• All data is stored locally on your device
• You can delete the app at any time to remove all local data
• You control what content you share through the app’s sharing features
• Crash reporting can be disabled (though this is currently controlled at the app level)
